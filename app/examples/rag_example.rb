# Example script demonstrating RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with LangchainRB and pgvector
#
# This example shows how to:
# 1. Create an embedding service
# 2. Add documents to the vector database
# 3. Perform similarity search
# 4. Use RAG for question answering
#
# To run this example:

  "Begin by preheating your oven to 375째F (190째C). Prepare four boneless, skinless chicken breasts by cutting a pocket into the side of each breast, being careful not to cut all the way through. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat. Add 1 small diced onion and 2 minced garlic cloves, and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add 8 ounces of fresh spinach and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.",

  "In a bowl, combine the spinach mixture with 4 ounces of softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Mix until well combined. Stuff each chicken breast pocket with an equal amount of the spinach mixture. Seal the pocket with a toothpick if necessary. In the same skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the stuffed chicken breasts and sear on each side for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown.",

  "To make classic chocolate chip cookies, preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup of softened butter, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of packed brown sugar until smooth. Beat in 2 eggs one at a time, then stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of baking soda in 2 teaspoons of hot water and add to the batter along with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Stir in 3 cups of all-purpose flour and 2 cups of chocolate chips. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets and bake for about 10 minutes or until edges are nicely browned.",

  "For a refreshing summer salad, combine 2 cups of diced watermelon, 1 cup of crumbled feta cheese, 1/2 cup of thinly sliced red onion, and 1/4 cup of chopped fresh mint leaves in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice, 1 tablespoon of honey, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Serve immediately for the best flavor and texture."
