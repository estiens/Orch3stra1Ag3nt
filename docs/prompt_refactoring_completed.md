# Prompt Refactoring Completion Report

## Overview
The prompt management and LLM call refactoring has been completed as per the plan outlined in `architecture_prompt_refactor_plan.md`. This document summarizes the changes made to simplify and future-proof prompt management within the application.

## Completed Changes

1. **Schema Migration**
   - Added `prompt_id` as an integer column to the `llm_calls` table with a foreign key to the `prompts` table.

2. **Model Updates**
   - Updated `LlmCall` model to include `belongs_to :prompt, optional: true` association.
   - Removed storage of full prompt text in `LlmCall` records, relying on `prompt_id` instead.

3. **Prompt Fetching and Recording**
   - Refactored `PromptService` to include `render_with_prompt` method that returns both the rendered content and the associated `Prompt` object.
   - Updated `UsesPrompts` concern to utilize the new method and return both content and prompt object from `render_prompt`.

4. **Agent/LLM Call Logic**
   - Modified `BaseAgent` to handle prompts as hashes containing content and prompt objects, ensuring `prompt_id` is set in `LlmCall` records during creation.

5. **Removal of Legacy Tracking**
   - Removed associations and usage of `PromptUsage`, `PromptEvaluation`, `PromptCategory`, and `PromptVersion` models from the codebase.
   - Integrated versioning directly within the `Prompt` model using fields like `version_number`, `template_content`, `version_message`, `version_updated_by`, and `version_updated_at`.
   - Added `has_many :llm_calls` to `Prompt` model for tracking usage via the new association.
   - Removed all commented code related to deleted models from the codebase.

## Key Points for Developers

- **Prompt Analytics and Metrics**: All analytics and metrics are now derived through the `LlmCall`-to-`Prompt` association using `prompt_id`. This eliminates duplication of prompt text in each call record.
- **Prompt Text Storage**: Prompt text is no longer duplicated in `LlmCall` records; only the reference (`prompt_id`) to the `Prompt` record is stored.
- **Version Information**: Version information is now stored directly in the `Prompt` model with fields such as `version_number`. Methods like `update_content` handle version increments and updates.
- **Categorization**: Prompts are connected to agents, and any categorization can be stored in the `metadata` field of the `Prompt` model.

## Future Considerations

- Any circumstantial logic for agents using different prompts in varying scenarios can be managed with join tables or additional metadata fields as requirements develop.
- A database migration is required to add versioning fields (`version_number`, `template_content`, `version_message`, `version_updated_by`, `version_updated_at`) to the `prompts` table if not already present.
- This refactoring establishes a foundation for advanced prompt analytics and detailed agent-prompt relationship modeling without relying on duplicating text or fragile join logic.

## Cleanup Tasks for User

- **Delete Model Files**: Manually delete the model files for `PromptCategory`, `PromptEvaluation`, `PromptUsage`, and `PromptVersion` located in `app/models/`.
- **Delete Factories and Specs**: Remove any associated factory and spec files for these models from `spec/factories/` and `spec/models/`.
- **Remove Migration Files**: Delete or update migration files related to these models, such as `db/migrate/*_create_prompt_versions.rb`, `db/migrate/*_create_prompt_usages.rb`, and `db/migrate/*_create_prompt_evaluations.rb`.
- **Remove Seed Data**: Delete or update seed data files like `db/seeds/prompt_categories.rb` that reference these models.

## Integration Notes

- **PromptService**: Always returns the prompt record alongside rendered content when using `render_with_prompt`.
- **UsesPrompts**: Agent code can access the prompt object or ID post-rendering via the returned hash from `render_prompt`.
- **Agent Code**: Ensures `prompt_id` is passed during `LlmCall` creation.

This refactoring enhances the maintainability and scalability of prompt management within the application, aligning with best practices for data association and storage.
