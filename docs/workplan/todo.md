# Event System Refactoring

## Implementation Status

We have successfully completed the initial implementation of the event system refactoring using Rails Event Store. The following components have been created and tested:

1. **Event Structure**
   - Created a base `BaseEvent` class that inherits from `RailsEventStore::Event`
   - Implemented tool-related event classes in the `ToolEvents` namespace
   - Added validation for event data using Dry::Schema
   - Created a `GenericEvent` class for handling unknown event types
   - Added backward compatibility with legacy Event model

2. **Event Publishing**
   - Created an `EventService` for publishing events
   - Implemented smart event type resolution to map string event types to classes
   - Added stream creation based on metadata (task, agent activity, project)
   - Added correlation IDs and timestamps to event metadata

3. **Event Handling**
   - Implemented a `BaseHandler` module for event handlers
   - Created a `ToolExecutionHandler` for tool-related events
   - Set up subscriptions in the event_subscriptions initializer

4. **Testing**
   - Added comprehensive specs for `BaseEvent`, tool events, event handlers, and `EventService`
   - Ensured all tests pass with proper mocking

## Next Steps

1. **Implement More Event Types** ✅
   - Created event classes for agent events (AgentStartedEvent, AgentCompletedEvent, etc.)
   - Created event classes for system events (SystemStartupEvent, SystemShutdownEvent, etc.)
   - Added proper schema validation using Dry::Schema
   - Implemented consistent event type naming convention (e.g., "agent.started", "system.error")

2. **Refactor Existing Event Consumers** ✅
   - Created example service showing how to transition from `Event.publish` to `EventService.publish`
   - Created mapping between old and new event types 
   - Added handlers for agent events and system events
   - Updated EventPublisher concern to use EventService instead of Event.publish
   - Updated BaseAgent to use EventService for event publishing
   - Updated CoordinatorAgent and its event handlers to use EventService.publish
   - Updated event handler subscriptions to handle both legacy and new event formats
   - Updated DashboardEventHandler to work with both legacy and new event types
   - Updated all tests to work with the new event system

3. **Add More Event Projections** ✅
   - Implemented EventCounterProjection as an example
   - Created ProjectionManager service for managing projections
   - Added support for rebuilding projections
   - Added initialization in the application startup

4. **Update Event Subscription System** ✅
   - Updated event_subscriptions.rb to include new event types
   - Added handlers for different event types (ToolExecutionHandler, AgentEventHandler, SystemEventHandler)
   - Added framework for transitioning from legacy EventBus to RailsEventStore subscriptions

5. **Add More Documentation** ✅
   - Added README.md in app/events with system architecture documentation
   - Added README.md in app/projections with usage examples
   - Added example code for migrating from old to new event system
   - Added inline documentation in all new classes

6. **Remaining Migration Tasks** ✅
   - Updated all instances of Event.publish to use EventService.publish
   - Updated EventSubscriber to work with RailsEventStore directly
   - Updated CoordinatorAgent to use the new event system consistently
   - Removed legacy EventBus registration system
   - Removed event_bus_setup.rb, event_system.rb and event_registry.rb files
   - Added configuration option to disable legacy Event record creation
   - Updated tests to skip legacy event system expectations
   
   Next steps:
   - Set Rails.configuration.create_event_records = false in production once confirmed stable
   - Remove legacy Event model and database table after transition period

7. **Performance Testing** (Not Started)
   - TODO: Test with high volume of events
   - TODO: Optimize if needed

## Architecture Notes

The new event system follows a more modular and decoupled approach:

- Events are first-class objects with their own validation
- Event publishing is handled by a dedicated service
- Events are stored in streams for better querying
- Legacy Event records are still created for backward compatibility
- Event handling is done through a subscription mechanism

This approach addresses the issues identified in the architectural review:

- Reduces coupling between components
- Makes the system more maintainable and testable
- Provides better scalability for future growth
- Improves the ability to reason about event flow

## Current Implementation

The current implementation serves as a strong foundation for the new event system. We have:

- Integrated Rails Event Store
- Created base classes and interfaces
- Implemented tool-related events as a proof of concept
- Added backward compatibility for existing code
- Written comprehensive tests

The system is ready for further enhancement with additional event types and handlers.
