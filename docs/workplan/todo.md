# Event System Refactoring

## Implementation Status

We have successfully completed the initial implementation of the event system refactoring using Rails Event Store. The following components have been created and tested:

1. **Event Structure**
   - Created a base `BaseEvent` class that inherits from `RailsEventStore::Event`
   - Implemented tool-related event classes in the `ToolEvents` namespace
   - Added validation for event data using Dry::Schema
   - Created a `GenericEvent` class for handling unknown event types
   - Added backward compatibility with legacy Event model

2. **Event Publishing**
   - Created an `EventService` for publishing events
   - Implemented smart event type resolution to map string event types to classes
   - Added stream creation based on metadata (task, agent activity, project)
   - Added correlation IDs and timestamps to event metadata

3. **Event Handling**
   - Implemented a `BaseHandler` module for event handlers
   - Created a `ToolExecutionHandler` for tool-related events
   - Set up subscriptions in the event_subscriptions initializer

4. **Testing**
   - Added comprehensive specs for `BaseEvent`, tool events, event handlers, and `EventService`
   - Ensured all tests pass with proper mocking

## Next Steps

1. **Implement More Event Types**
   - Create event classes for agent events, system events, and other event types
   - Update existing event consumers to use the new classes

2. **Refactor Existing Event Consumers**
   - Transition from using `Event.publish` to `EventService.publish`
   - Update handlers to handle RailsEventStore events

3. **Add More Event Projections**
   - Implement event projections for common queries
   - Add a way to rebuild projections if needed

4. **Update Event Subscription System**
   - Fully transition from legacy EventBus to RailsEventStore subscriptions
   - Add more handlers for different event types

5. **Add More Documentation**
   - Document the event system architecture
   - Add examples for creating new events and handlers

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with high volume of events
   - Optimize if needed

## Architecture Notes

The new event system follows a more modular and decoupled approach:

- Events are first-class objects with their own validation
- Event publishing is handled by a dedicated service
- Events are stored in streams for better querying
- Legacy Event records are still created for backward compatibility
- Event handling is done through a subscription mechanism

This approach addresses the issues identified in the architectural review:

- Reduces coupling between components
- Makes the system more maintainable and testable
- Provides better scalability for future growth
- Improves the ability to reason about event flow

## Current Implementation

The current implementation serves as a strong foundation for the new event system. We have:

- Integrated Rails Event Store
- Created base classes and interfaces
- Implemented tool-related events as a proof of concept
- Added backward compatibility for existing code
- Written comprehensive tests

The system is ready for further enhancement with additional event types and handlers.
