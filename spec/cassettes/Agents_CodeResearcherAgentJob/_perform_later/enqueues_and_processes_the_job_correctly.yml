        FAR (Significant findings discovered):\n```\nNo notes taken yet.\n```\n\nLAST
        TOOL RESULT (Output or error from your previous action):\n```\nNo tool executed
        yet.\n```\n\nAVAILABLE TOOLS (Use these to explore and gather information):\n-
        analyze_code_question: Break down a code-related research question\n- shell_command:
        Execute a shell command (safely within allowed directories)\n- search_code_base:
        Search the code base for code examples using ripgrep (takes ''query: \u003cyour
        query here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory: Examine a directory and generate
        a textual summary of its contents using the code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path:
        \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n- search_for_examples: Search for code examples
        on a topic\n- explain_code: Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes:
        IMPORTANT: Document findings about the codebase. Use this after discoveries
        to build the final report. Each note should contain specific, detailed observations.
        Pass (note: \u003cnote)\n- compile_findings: Compile research notes into structured
        findings\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES,
        and LAST TOOL RESULT, determine the single best *next action* to progress
        towards answering the question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow
        these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific
        information is still needed?\n2.  **Review Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES.
        What parts of the codebase have been explored? What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate
        Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful
        information (file listing, file content, search results, directory summary):
        What key insight does it provide? Does it suggest the next file/directory
        to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now* to record this insight before
        moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why did it fail (e.g., file not found,
        command error)? Can I try an alternative (different path, simpler command,
        different tool)? Should I use `take_notes` to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan
        Next Step:** Decide the most logical next exploration target (e.g., examine
        root directory, list files in `app/models`, read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`,
        search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single
        tool* that directly achieves your planned next step. Prioritize `take_notes`
        if step 3 identified key info to save *before* exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate
        Action:** Construct the arguments for the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL
        USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`: Your primary exploration tool.
        Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`: To list contents
        of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore subdirectories.\n    *   `cat
        \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents of a *specific* file identified
        via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`:
        For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**: Generic commands
        like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`: Use when you need
        a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by `code2prompt`. Useful
        for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services` *before* diving
        into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A
        hash of arguments for the chosen tool (string keys and values). Empty if action
        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---

        \ \\nThis example demonstrates basic error handling in Ruby using `begin`,
        `rescue`, and `ensure`. If the file doesn't exist, an `Errno::ENOENT` exception
        is raised and handled in the `rescue` block. The `ensure` block runs regardless
        of whether an error occurred, ensuring resources are cleaned up.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##
        Example 2\\n```ruby\\ndef divide(a, b)\\n  begin\\n    result = a / b\\n  rescue
        ZeroDivisionError\\n    puts \\\"You can't divide by zero!\\\"\\n    result
        = nil\\n  end\\n  result\\nend\\n\\nputs divide(10, 2)   # Outputs: 5\\nputs
        divide(10, 0)   # Outputs: You can't divide by zero!\\n```\\n**Explanation**:
        \ \\nThis function demonstrates handling a specific exception (`ZeroDivisionError`)
        inside a method. If division by zero is attempted, the error is caught, a
        message is printed, and `nil` is returned instead of crashing the program.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##
        Example 3\\n```ruby\\nbegin\\n  # Simulate an error\\n  raise ArgumentError,
        \\\"Invalid argument!\\\"\\nrescue ArgumentError => e\\n  puts \\\"Caught
        an argument error: #{e.message}\\\"\\nrescue StandardError => e\\n  puts \\\"Caught
        a standard error: #{e.message}\\\"\\nelse\\n  puts \\\"No errors occurred.\\\"\\nend\\n```\\n**Explanation**:
        \ \\nThis example shows multiple `rescue` clauses to handle different exception
        types separately. The `else` block runs only if no exceptions are raised in
        the `begin` block.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common Variations\\n\\n- **Rescuing Multiple
        Exceptions**:  \\n  You can rescue multiple exception types in a single line:\\n
        \ ```ruby\\n  rescue IOError, SystemCallError => e\\n    puts \\\"IO or system
        call error: #{e.message}\\\"\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Rescue Modifier**:  \\n  For
        simple expressions, you can use the rescue modifier:\\n  ```ruby\\n  value
        = Integer(\\\"abc\\\") rescue 0\\n  # value is 0 if conversion fails\\n  ```\\n\\n-
        **Custom Exception Classes**:  \\n  You can define and raise your own exceptions:\\n
        \ ```ruby\\n  class MyCustomError < StandardError; end\\n\\n  raise MyCustomError,
        \\\"Something went wrong!\\\"\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Retrying**:  \\n  The `retry`
        keyword can be used to repeat the `begin` block:\\n  ```ruby\\n  attempts
        = 0\\n  begin\\n    # code that might fail\\n  rescue\\n    attempts += 1\\n
        \   retry if attempts < 3\\n  end\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Global Exception Handling**:
        \ \\n  Rescue `Exception` to catch all errors (not recommended unless absolutely
        necessary):\\n  ```ruby\\n  rescue Exception => e\\n    puts \\\"Caught all
        exceptions: #{e.message}\\\"\\n  ```\\n  Use this with caution, as it can
        also catch system-exiting exceptions.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_a1102cf978\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":88,\"completion_tokens\":706,\"total_tokens\":794,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"

        analyze_code_question: Break down a code-related research question\n- shell_command:
        Execute a shell command (safely within allowed directories)\n- search_code_base:
        Search the code base for code examples using ripgrep (takes ''query: \u003cyour
        query here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory: Examine a directory and generate
        a textual summary of its contents using the code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path:
        \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n- search_for_examples: Search for code examples
        on a topic\n- explain_code: Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes:
        IMPORTANT: Document findings about the codebase. Use this after discoveries
        to build the final report. Each note should contain specific, detailed observations.
        Pass (note: \u003cnote)\n- compile_findings: Compile research notes into structured
        findings\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES,
        and LAST TOOL RESULT, determine the single best *next action* to progress
        towards answering the question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow
        these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific
        information is still needed?\n2.  **Review Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES.
        What parts of the codebase have been explored? What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate
        Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful
        information (file listing, file content, search results, directory summary):
        What key insight does it provide? Does it suggest the next file/directory
        to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now* to record this insight before
        moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why did it fail (e.g., file not found,
        command error)? Can I try an alternative (different path, simpler command,
        different tool)? Should I use `take_notes` to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan
        Next Step:** Decide the most logical next exploration target (e.g., examine
        root directory, list files in `app/models`, read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`,
        search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single
        tool* that directly achieves your planned next step. Prioritize `take_notes`
        if step 3 identified key info to save *before* exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate
        Action:** Construct the arguments for the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL
        USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`: Your primary exploration tool.
        Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`: To list contents
        of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore subdirectories.\n    *   `cat
        \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents of a *specific* file identified
        via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`:
        For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**: Generic commands
        like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`: Use when you need
        a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by `code2prompt`. Useful
        for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services` *before* diving
        into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A
        hash of arguments for the chosen tool (string keys and values). Empty if action
        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---

        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A

        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---

        AND GOAL\nYou are a meticulous Automated Code Explorer. Your primary objective
        is to systematically navigate and understand the codebase to gather information
        that comprehensively answers the user''s question.\nUSER QUESTION: Task Title:
        Research Ruby error handling\n\nTask Description:\nFind best practices for
        error handling in Ruby\n\nSpecific Instructions for this Run:\nHow should
        I handle errors in Ruby?\n\n# ANTI-REPETITION DIRECTIVE\nYou MUST avoid redundant
        actions. Do NOT:\n- Examine directories already listed below.\n- Run commands
        substantially similar to those already run.\n- Take notes covering information
        already recorded.\n\n# CURRENT EXPLORATION STATUS\nIteration: 5/50\n\nDIRECTORIES
        ALREADY EXAMINED (via ''examine_directory''):\n- None yet\n\nRECENT SHELL
        COMMANDS ALREADY RUN (via ''shell_command''):\n- None yet\n\nNOTES TAKEN SO
        FAR (Significant findings discovered):\n```\nRuby error handling is typically
        done using the `begin`, `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure` blocks. Key best practices
        include rescuing only specific exceptions rather than generic ones, cleaning
        up resources in the `ensure` block, and providing meaningful error messages
        or fallback behavior. Examples include handling file not found errors with
        `rescue Errno::ENOENT`, handling division by zero with `rescue ZeroDivisionError`,
        and using `ensure` to guarantee resource cleanup. It is also possible to rescue
        multiple exception types and to raise custom errors as needed.\n```\n\nLAST
        TOOL RESULT (Output or error from your previous action):\n```\nError executing
        tool ''search_for_examples'': Error executing tool ''search_for_examples'':
        missing keyword: :topic\n```\n\nAVAILABLE TOOLS (Use these to explore and
        gather information):\n- analyze_code_question: Break down a code-related research
        question\n- shell_command: Execute a shell command (safely within allowed
        directories)\n- search_code_base: Search the code base for code examples using
        ripgrep (takes ''query: \u003cyour query here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory:
        Examine a directory and generate a textual summary of its contents using the
        code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path: \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n-
        search_for_examples: Search for code examples on a topic\n- explain_code:
        Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes: IMPORTANT: Document findings
        about the codebase. Use this after discoveries to build the final report.
        Each note should contain specific, detailed observations. Pass (note: \u003cnote)\n-
        compile_findings: Compile research notes into structured findings\n\n=== YOUR
        TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES, and LAST TOOL RESULT,
        determine the single best *next action* to progress towards answering the
        question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze
        Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific information is still needed?\n2.  **Review
        Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES. What parts of the codebase have been explored?
        What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL
        RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful information (file listing, file content,
        search results, directory summary): What key insight does it provide? Does
        it suggest the next file/directory to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now*
        to record this insight before moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why
        did it fail (e.g., file not found, command error)? Can I try an alternative
        (different path, simpler command, different tool)? Should I use `take_notes`
        to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan Next Step:** Decide the most logical next
        exploration target (e.g., examine root directory, list files in `app/models`,
        read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select
        Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single tool* that directly achieves your planned
        next step. Prioritize `take_notes` if step 3 identified key info to save *before*
        exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate Action:** Construct the arguments for
        the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`:
        Your primary exploration tool. Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`:
        To list contents of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore
        subdirectories.\n    *   `cat \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents
        of a *specific* file identified via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e
        \u003cfile\u003e`: For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**:
        Generic commands like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`:
        Use when you need a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by
        `code2prompt`. Useful for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services`
        *before* diving into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===

        Example 1\\n```ruby\\nbegin\\n  # Attempt to open and read a file\\n  file
        = File.open(\\\"data.txt\\\", \\\"r\\\")\\n  contents = file.read\\n  puts
        contents\\nrescue Errno::ENOENT => e\\n  # Handle the case where the file
        does not exist\\n  puts \\\"File not found: #{e.message}\\\"\\nensure\\n  #
        Always close the file if it was opened\\n  file.close if file\\nend\\n```\\n**Explanation**:
        \ \\nThis example demonstrates basic error handling when working with files.
        The `begin` block wraps code that might raise an exception. If the file doesn't
        exist, an `Errno::ENOENT` exception is raised and handled in the `rescue`
        block. The `ensure` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred,
        ensuring the file is closed if it was opened.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example 2\\n```ruby\\ndef
        divide(a, b)\\n  begin\\n    result = a / b\\n    puts \\\"Result: #{result}\\\"\\n
        \ rescue ZeroDivisionError\\n    puts \\\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\\\"\\n
        \ end\\nend\\n\\ndivide(10, 2)   # Output: Result: 5\\ndivide(5, 0)    # Output:
        Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\\n```\\n**Explanation**:  \\nThis
        function attempts to divide two numbers. If the denominator is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError`
        is raised and handled gracefully, preventing the program from crashing and
        providing a user-friendly message.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example 3\\n```ruby\\nbegin\\n
        \ # Simulate an operation that may fail\\n  raise ArgumentError, \\\"Invalid
        argument!\\\"\\nrescue ArgumentError => e\\n  puts \\\"Caught an argument
        error: #{e.message}\\\"\\nrescue StandardError => e\\n  puts \\\"Caught a
        standard error: #{e.message}\\\"\\nelse\\n  puts \\\"No errors occurred.\\\"\\nend\\n```\\n**Explanation**:
        \ \\nThis example shows handling multiple exception types. The `rescue` clauses
        are ordered from most specific to most general. If an `ArgumentError` is raised,
        it's caught by the first `rescue`. If another kind of `StandardError` is raised,
        it's caught by the second. The `else` block runs only if no exceptions were
        raised.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common Variations\\n\\n- **Inline rescue**: You can
        rescue exceptions inline for simple cases:\\n  ```ruby\\n  value = Integer(\\\"abc\\\")
        rescue 0  # value will be 0 if conversion fails\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Rescuing
        multiple exceptions**: You can rescue multiple exception types in one line:\\n
        \ ```ruby\\n  rescue IOError, SystemCallError => e\\n    puts \\\"IO or system
        error: #{e.message}\\\"\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Custom exceptions**: Define and raise
        your own exceptions:\\n  ```ruby\\n  class MyCustomError < StandardError;
        end\\n\\n  raise MyCustomError, \\\"Something went wrong!\\\"\\n  ```\\n\\n-
        **Retrying**: Use `retry` to attempt the block again after handling an exception:\\n
        \ ```ruby\\n  attempts = 0\\n  begin\\n    # risky operation\\n  rescue SomeError\\n
        \   attempts += 1\\n    retry if attempts < 3\\n  end\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Using

        AND GOAL\nYou are a meticulous Automated Code Explorer. Your primary objective
        is to systematically navigate and understand the codebase to gather information
        that comprehensively answers the user''s question.\nUSER QUESTION: Task Title:
        Research Ruby error handling\n\nTask Description:\nFind best practices for
        error handling in Ruby\n\nSpecific Instructions for this Run:\nHow should
        I handle errors in Ruby?\n\n# ANTI-REPETITION DIRECTIVE\nYou MUST avoid redundant
        actions. Do NOT:\n- Examine directories already listed below.\n- Run commands
        substantially similar to those already run.\n- Take notes covering information
        already recorded.\n\n# CURRENT EXPLORATION STATUS\nIteration: 6/50\n\nDIRECTORIES
        ALREADY EXAMINED (via ''examine_directory''):\n- None yet\n\nRECENT SHELL
        COMMANDS ALREADY RUN (via ''shell_command''):\n- None yet\n\nNOTES TAKEN SO
        FAR (Significant findings discovered):\n```\nRuby error handling is typically
        done using the `begin`, `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure` blocks. Key best practices
        include rescuing only specific exceptions rather than generic ones, cleaning
        up resources in the `ensure` block, and providing meaningful error messages
        or fallback behavior. Examples include handling file not found errors with
        `rescue Errno::ENOENT`, handling division by zero with `rescue ZeroDivisionError`,
        and using `ensure` to guarantee resource cleanup. It is also possible to rescue
        multiple exception types and to raise custom errors as needed.\n```\n\nLAST
        TOOL RESULT (Output or error from your previous action):\n```\n## Example
        1\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # Attempt to open and read a file\n  file = File.open(\"data.txt\",
        \"r\")\n  contents = file.read\n  puts contents\nrescue Errno::ENOENT =\u003e
        e\n  # Handle the case where the file does not exist\n  puts \"File not found:
        #{e.message}\"\nensure\n  # Always close the file if it was opened\n  file.close
        if file\nend\n```\n**Explanation**:  \nThis example demonstrates basic error
        handling when working with files. The `begin` block wraps code that might
        raise an exception. If the file doesn''t exist, an `Errno::ENOENT` exception
        is raised and handled in the `rescue` block. The `ensure` block runs regardless
        of whether an exception occurred, ensuring the file is closed if it was opened.\n\n---\n\n##
        Example 2\n```ruby\ndef divide(a, b)\n  begin\n    result = a / b\n    puts
        \"Result: #{result}\"\n  rescue ZeroDivisionError\n    puts \"Error: Division
        by zero is not allowed.\"\n  end\nend\n\ndivide(10, 2)   # Output: Result:
        5\ndivide(5, 0)    # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n```\n**Explanation**:  \nThis
        function attempts to divide two numbers. If the denominator is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError`
        is raised and handled gracefully, preventing the program from crashing and
        providing a user-friendly message.\n\n---\n\n## Example 3\n```ruby\nbegin\n  #
        Simulate an operation that may fail\n  raise ArgumentError, \"Invalid argument!\"\nrescue
        ArgumentError =\u003e e\n  puts \"Caught an argument error: #{e.message}\"\nrescue
        StandardError =\u003e e\n  puts \"Caught a standard error: #{e.message...
        (result truncated)\n```\n\nAVAILABLE TOOLS (Use these to explore and gather
        information):\n- analyze_code_question: Break down a code-related research
        question\n- shell_command: Execute a shell command (safely within allowed
        directories)\n- search_code_base: Search the code base for code examples using
        ripgrep (takes ''query: \u003cyour query here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory:
        Examine a directory and generate a textual summary of its contents using the
        code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path: \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n-
        search_for_examples: Search for code examples on a topic\n- explain_code:
        Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes: IMPORTANT: Document findings
        about the codebase. Use this after discoveries to build the final report.
        Each note should contain specific, detailed observations. Pass (note: \u003cnote)\n-
        compile_findings: Compile research notes into structured findings\n\n=== YOUR
        TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES, and LAST TOOL RESULT,
        determine the single best *next action* to progress towards answering the
        question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze
        Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific information is still needed?\n2.  **Review
        Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES. What parts of the codebase have been explored?
        What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL
        RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful information (file listing, file content,
        search results, directory summary): What key insight does it provide? Does
        it suggest the next file/directory to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now*
        to record this insight before moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why
        did it fail (e.g., file not found, command error)? Can I try an alternative
        (different path, simpler command, different tool)? Should I use `take_notes`
        to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan Next Step:** Decide the most logical next
        exploration target (e.g., examine root directory, list files in `app/models`,
        read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select
        Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single tool* that directly achieves your planned
        next step. Prioritize `take_notes` if step 3 identified key info to save *before*
        exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate Action:** Construct the arguments for
        the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`:
        Your primary exploration tool. Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`:
        To list contents of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore
        subdirectories.\n    *   `cat \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents
        of a *specific* file identified via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e
        \u003cfile\u003e`: For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**:
        Generic commands like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`:
        Use when you need a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by
        `code2prompt`. Useful for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services`
        *before* diving into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A

        AND GOAL\nYou are a meticulous Automated Code Explorer. Your primary objective
        is to systematically navigate and understand the codebase to gather information
        that comprehensively answers the user''s question.\nUSER QUESTION: Task Title:
        Research Ruby error handling\n\nTask Description:\nFind best practices for
        error handling in Ruby\n\nSpecific Instructions for this Run:\nHow should
        I handle errors in Ruby?\n\n# ANTI-REPETITION DIRECTIVE\nYou MUST avoid redundant
        actions. Do NOT:\n- Examine directories already listed below.\n- Run commands
        substantially similar to those already run.\n- Take notes covering information
        already recorded.\n\n# CURRENT EXPLORATION STATUS\nIteration: 8/50\n\nDIRECTORIES
        ALREADY EXAMINED (via ''examine_directory''):\n- None yet\n\nRECENT SHELL
        COMMANDS ALREADY RUN (via ''shell_command''):\n- None yet\n\nNOTES TAKEN SO
        FAR (Significant findings discovered):\n```\nRuby error handling is typically
        done using the `begin`, `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure` blocks. Key best practices
        include rescuing only specific exceptions rather than generic ones, cleaning
        up resources in the `ensure` block, and providing meaningful error messages
        or fallback behavior. Examples include handling file not found errors with
        `rescue Errno::ENOENT`, handling division by zero with `rescue ZeroDivisionError`,
        and using `ensure` to guarantee resource cleanup. It is also possible to rescue
        multiple exception types and to raise custom errors as needed.\n---\nThe last
        result provided three concrete Ruby error handling examples, illustrating
        the use of begin-rescue-ensure blocks, rescuing specific exceptions, and raising/handling
        custom exceptions. These examples reinforce best practices: rescue only specific
        exceptions, use ensure for cleanup, and provide meaningful error messages.
        This aligns with the previously noted best practices and provides practical
        code samples for reference.\n```\n\nLAST TOOL RESULT (Output or error from
        your previous action):\n```\nError executing tool ''search_for_examples'':
        Error executing tool ''search_for_examples'': missing keyword: :topic\n```\n\nAVAILABLE
        TOOLS (Use these to explore and gather information):\n- analyze_code_question:
        Break down a code-related research question\n- shell_command: Execute a shell
        command (safely within allowed directories)\n- search_code_base: Search the
        code base for code examples using ripgrep (takes ''query: \u003cyour query
        here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory: Examine a directory and generate a textual
        summary of its contents using the code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path:
        \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n- search_for_examples: Search for code examples
        on a topic\n- explain_code: Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes:
        IMPORTANT: Document findings about the codebase. Use this after discoveries
        to build the final report. Each note should contain specific, detailed observations.
        Pass (note: \u003cnote)\n- compile_findings: Compile research notes into structured
        findings\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES,
        and LAST TOOL RESULT, determine the single best *next action* to progress
        towards answering the question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow
        these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific
        information is still needed?\n2.  **Review Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES.
        What parts of the codebase have been explored? What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate
        Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful
        information (file listing, file content, search results, directory summary):
        What key insight does it provide? Does it suggest the next file/directory
        to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now* to record this insight before
        moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why did it fail (e.g., file not found,
        command error)? Can I try an alternative (different path, simpler command,
        different tool)? Should I use `take_notes` to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan
        Next Step:** Decide the most logical next exploration target (e.g., examine
        root directory, list files in `app/models`, read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`,
        search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single
        tool* that directly achieves your planned next step. Prioritize `take_notes`
        if step 3 identified key info to save *before* exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate
        Action:** Construct the arguments for the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL
        USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`: Your primary exploration tool.
        Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`: To list contents
        of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore subdirectories.\n    *   `cat
        \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents of a *specific* file identified
        via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`:
        For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**: Generic commands
        like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`: Use when you need
        a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by `code2prompt`. Useful
        for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services` *before* diving
        into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A
        hash of arguments for the chosen tool (string keys and values). Empty if action
        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---

        AND GOAL\nYou are a meticulous Automated Code Explorer. Your primary objective
        is to systematically navigate and understand the codebase to gather information
        that comprehensively answers the user''s question.\nUSER QUESTION: Task Title:
        Research Ruby error handling\n\nTask Description:\nFind best practices for
        error handling in Ruby\n\nSpecific Instructions for this Run:\nHow should
        I handle errors in Ruby?\n\n# ANTI-REPETITION DIRECTIVE\nYou MUST avoid redundant
        actions. Do NOT:\n- Examine directories already listed below.\n- Run commands
        substantially similar to those already run.\n- Take notes covering information
        already recorded.\n\n# CURRENT EXPLORATION STATUS\nIteration: 10/50\n\nDIRECTORIES
        ALREADY EXAMINED (via ''examine_directory''):\n- None yet\n\nRECENT SHELL
        COMMANDS ALREADY RUN (via ''shell_command''):\n- None yet\n\nNOTES TAKEN SO
        FAR (Significant findings discovered):\n```\nRuby error handling is typically
        done using the `begin`, `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure` blocks. Key best practices
        include rescuing only specific exceptions rather than generic ones, cleaning
        up resources in the `ensure` block, and providing meaningful error messages
        or fallback behavior. Examples include handling file not found errors with
        `rescue Errno::ENOENT`, handling division by zero with `rescue ZeroDivisionError`,
        and using `ensure` to guarantee resource cleanup. It is also possible to rescue
        multiple exception types and to raise custom errors as needed.\n---\nThe last
        result provided three concrete Ruby error handling examples, illustrating
        the use of begin-rescue-ensure blocks, rescuing specific exceptions, and raising/handling
        custom exceptions. These examples reinforce best practices: rescue only specific
        exceptions, use ensure for cleanup, and provide meaningful error messages.
        This aligns with the previously noted best practices and provides practical
        code samples for reference.\n```\n\nLAST TOOL RESULT (Output or error from
        your previous action):\n```\nError executing tool ''search_for_examples'':
        Error executing tool ''search_for_examples'': missing keyword: :topic\n```\n\nAVAILABLE
        TOOLS (Use these to explore and gather information):\n- analyze_code_question:
        Break down a code-related research question\n- shell_command: Execute a shell
        command (safely within allowed directories)\n- search_code_base: Search the
        code base for code examples using ripgrep (takes ''query: \u003cyour query
        here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory: Examine a directory and generate a textual
        summary of its contents using the code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path:
        \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n- search_for_examples: Search for code examples
        on a topic\n- explain_code: Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes:
        IMPORTANT: Document findings about the codebase. Use this after discoveries
        to build the final report. Each note should contain specific, detailed observations.
        Pass (note: \u003cnote)\n- compile_findings: Compile research notes into structured
        findings\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES,
        and LAST TOOL RESULT, determine the single best *next action* to progress
        towards answering the question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow
        these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific
        information is still needed?\n2.  **Review Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES.
        What parts of the codebase have been explored? What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate
        Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful
        information (file listing, file content, search results, directory summary):
        What key insight does it provide? Does it suggest the next file/directory
        to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now* to record this insight before
        moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why did it fail (e.g., file not found,
        command error)? Can I try an alternative (different path, simpler command,
        different tool)? Should I use `take_notes` to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan
        Next Step:** Decide the most logical next exploration target (e.g., examine
        root directory, list files in `app/models`, read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`,
        search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single
        tool* that directly achieves your planned next step. Prioritize `take_notes`
        if step 3 identified key info to save *before* exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate
        Action:** Construct the arguments for the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL
        USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`: Your primary exploration tool.
        Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`: To list contents
        of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore subdirectories.\n    *   `cat
        \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents of a *specific* file identified
        via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`:
        For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**: Generic commands
        like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`: Use when you need
        a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by `code2prompt`. Useful
        for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services` *before* diving
        into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A
        hash of arguments for the chosen tool (string keys and values). Empty if action
        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---

        RESEARCH SYNTHESIS TASK\n\nSynthesize these research notes into a comprehensive
        technical documentation about:\nTOPIC: \"Research Ruby error handling\"\n\n#
        SOURCE NOTES\nNote 1:\nRuby error handling is typically done using the `begin`,
        `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure` blocks. Key best practices include rescuing
        only specific exceptions rather than generic ones, cleaning up resources in
        the `ensure` block, and providing meaningful error messages or fallback behavior.
        Examples include handling file not found errors with `rescue Errno::ENOENT`,
        handling division by zero with `rescue ZeroDivisionError`, and using `ensure`
        to guarantee resource cleanup. It is also possible to rescue multiple exception
        types and to raise custom errors as needed.\n\n---\n\nNote 2:\nThe last result
        provided three concrete Ruby error handling examples, illustrating the use
        of begin-rescue-ensure blocks, rescuing specific exceptions, and raising/handling
        custom exceptions. These examples reinforce best practices: rescue only specific
        exceptions, use ensure for cleanup, and provide meaningful error messages.
        This aligns with the previously noted best practices and provides practical
        code samples for reference.\n\n# EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT\nCreate a professional

        Research Ruby Error Handling\\n\\n## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n\\nRuby's error
        handling system is built around the `begin`, `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure`
        constructs, providing a robust mechanism for managing exceptions and ensuring
        resource cleanup. The research highlights that best practices in Ruby error
        handling focus on rescuing only specific exceptions, using the `ensure` block
        for cleanup, and providing meaningful error messages or fallback behaviors.
        Custom exceptions can be defined and raised as needed, allowing for granular
        control over error flows.\\n\\nKey insights include the importance of specificity
        in exception handling to avoid masking bugs, the use of `ensure` to guarantee
        resource deallocation, and the value of clear, actionable error messages.
        Adhering to these principles results in more maintainable, reliable, and predictable
        Ruby applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. CODEBASE ARCHITECTURE\\n\\nRuby error
        handling is structured around the following core components:\\n\\n- **Exception
        Classes**: Ruby provides a hierarchy of exception classes (e.g., `StandardError`,
        `Errno::ENOENT`, `ZeroDivisionError`). Custom exceptions can be defined by
        subclassing `StandardError`.\\n- **Error Handling Blocks**: The `begin` block
        encapsulates code that may raise exceptions. The `rescue` block(s) handle
        specific exceptions. The optional `else` block runs if no exceptions occur,
        and the `ensure` block always runs, regardless of exceptions.\\n- **Control
        Flow**: Error handling is woven into the normal control flow, allowing for
        clean separation of error management and business logic.\\n\\n**Design Patterns
        and Principles:**\\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Error handling
        is separated from business logic.\\n- **Fail Fast**: By rescuing only specific
        exceptions, the code avoids hiding unexpected errors.\\n- **Resource Management**:
        The `ensure` block is used for deterministic cleanup, similar to `finally`
        in other languages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\\n\\n### Important
        Classes, Methods, and Functions\\n\\n- **Standard Exception Handling Syntax:**\\n
        \   ```ruby\\n    begin\\n      # risky operation\\n    rescue SpecificException
        => e\\n      # handle error\\n    else\\n      # runs if no exception\\n    ensure\\n
        \     # always runs (cleanup)\\n    end\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Rescuing Specific
        Exceptions:**\\n    ```ruby\\n    begin\\n      File.read('nonexistent.txt')\\n
        \   rescue Errno::ENOENT => e\\n      puts \\\"File not found: #{e.message}\\\"\\n
        \   end\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Handling Multiple Exceptions:**\\n    ```ruby\\n
        \   begin\\n      # risky operations\\n    rescue Errno::ENOENT, ZeroDivisionError
        => e\\n      puts \\\"Handled error: #{e.class} - #{e.message}\\\"\\n    end\\n
        \   ```\\n\\n- **Custom Exception Classes:**\\n    ```ruby\\n    class MyCustomError
        < StandardError; end\\n\\n    begin\\n      raise MyCustomError, \\\"Something
        went wrong\\\"\\n    rescue MyCustomError => e\\n      puts e.message\\n    end\\n
        \   ```\\n\\n- **Resource Cleanup with `ensure`:**\\n    ```ruby\\n    file
        = File.open('data.txt', 'r')\\n    begin\\n      # process file\\n    rescue
        => e\\n      puts \\\"Error: #{e.message}\\\"\\n    ensure\\n      file.close
        if file\\n    end\\n    ```\\n\\n### Workflow and Control Flow\\n\\n1. **Begin
        Block**: Encapsulates code that may fail.\\n2. **Rescue Block(s)**: Catches
        and handles specific exceptions.\\n3. **Else Block**: Executes if no exceptions
        are raised.\\n4. **Ensure Block**: Executes regardless of exceptions, typically
        for cleanup.\\n\\n### Notable Techniques\\n\\n- **Selective Exception Handling**:
        Only handle known, expected errors.\\n- **Custom Exception Types**: For domain-specific
        error signaling.\\n- **Guaranteed Cleanup**: Using `ensure` for resource management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##
        4. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n- **Specificity in Exception
        Handling**: Reduces risk of masking bugs.\\n- **Resource Safety**: `ensure`
        guarantees cleanup, preventing resource leaks.\\n- **Clear Error Messaging**:
        Provides actionable information for debugging and user feedback.\\n- **Extensibility**:
        Custom exceptions enable more granular error management.\\n\\n### Potential
        Issues / Improvement Areas\\n\\n- **Overly Broad Rescue**: Using `rescue`
        without specifying exception types can hide programming errors and make debugging
        difficult.\\n- **Missing Cleanup**: Omitting `ensure` may result in resource
        leaks.\\n- **Uninformative Error Messages**: Failing to provide context in
        error messages can hinder troubleshooting.\\n\\n### Code Smells / Anti-Patterns\\n\\n-
        **Rescuing `Exception` or Omitting Exception Type**: Catches system-level
        errors (like `NoMemoryError`), which should generally not be handled.\\n-
        **Empty Rescue Blocks**: Swallow errors without logging or handling.\\n- **Resource
        Management Outside `ensure`**: Risks leaving resources open or in inconsistent
        states.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. RECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\n### Actionable Recommendations\\n\\n1.
        **Rescue Specific Exceptions Only**: Always specify the exception class in
        `rescue` clauses.\\n2. **Use `ensure` for Cleanup**: Place all resource deallocation
        and cleanup logic in `ensure` blocks.\\n3. **Provide Meaningful Error Messages**:
        Include context and actionable information in error messages.\\n4. **Define
        Custom Exceptions**: For domain-specific error handling, subclass `StandardError`.\\n5.
        **Log or Handle All Rescued Errors**: Never leave rescue blocks empty.\\n\\n###
        Refactoring Opportunities\\n\\n- Refactor any generic `rescue` blocks to handle
        only specific exceptions.\\n- Move resource cleanup code into `ensure` blocks.\\n-
        Replace ambiguous error messages with detailed, context-rich ones.\\n\\n###
        Best Practices\\n\\n- **Fail Fast**: Let unexpected errors propagate to avoid
        hiding bugs.\\n- **Test Error Paths**: Write tests for exception-raising scenarios.\\n-
        **Document Custom Exceptions**: Clearly document the purpose and usage of
        any custom exception classes.\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, Ruby
        codebases will be more robust, maintainable, and easier to debug, resulting
        in higher overall code quality and reliability.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_ac00b0000c\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":425,\"completion_tokens\":1268,\"total_tokens\":1693,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
