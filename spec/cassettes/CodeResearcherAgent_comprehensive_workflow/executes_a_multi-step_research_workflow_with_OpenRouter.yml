        Execute a shell command (safely within allowed directories)\n- search_code_base:

        query here\u003e'') \n- examine_directory: Examine a directory and generate
        a textual summary of its contents using the code2prompt tool. Takes ''directory_path:
        \u003cpath to directory\u003e''.\n- search_for_examples: Search for code examples
        on a topic\n- explain_code: Explain how a piece of code works\n- take_notes:
        IMPORTANT: Document findings about the codebase. Use this after discoveries
        to build the final report. Each note should contain specific, detailed observations.

        findings\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nBased on the USER QUESTION, CURRENT NOTES,
        and LAST TOOL RESULT, determine the single best *next action* to progress
        towards answering the question.\n\n=== STRATEGIC THINKING PROCESS (Follow
        these steps): ===\n1.  **Analyze Goal:** Re-read the USER QUESTION. What specific
        information is still needed?\n2.  **Review Context:** Examine CURRENT NOTES.
        What parts of the codebase have been explored? What remains unknown?\n3.  **Evaluate
        Last Result:** Analyze the LAST TOOL RESULT.\n    *   If it contains useful
        information (file listing, file content, search results, directory summary):
        What key insight does it provide? Does it suggest the next file/directory
        to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now* to record this insight before
        moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why did it fail (e.g., file not found,
        command error)? Can I try an alternative (different path, simpler command,
        different tool)? Should I use `take_notes` to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan
        Next Step:** Decide the most logical next exploration target (e.g., examine
        root directory, list files in `app/models`, read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`,
        search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single
        tool* that directly achieves your planned next step. Prioritize `take_notes`
        if step 3 identified key info to save *before* exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate
        Action:** Construct the arguments for the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL
        USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`: Your primary exploration tool.
        Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`: To list contents
        of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore subdirectories.\n    *   `cat
        \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents of a *specific* file identified
        via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`:
        For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**: Generic commands
        like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`: Use when you need
        a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by `code2prompt`. Useful
        for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services` *before* diving
        into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A
        hash of arguments for the chosen tool (string keys and values). Empty if action
        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---

        What key insight does it provide? Does it suggest the next file/directory
        to examine? Should I use `take_notes` *now* to record this insight before
        moving on?\n    *   If it was an error: Why did it fail (e.g., file not found,
        command error)? Can I try an alternative (different path, simpler command,
        different tool)? Should I use `take_notes` to record the obstacle?\n4.  **Plan
        Next Step:** Decide the most logical next exploration target (e.g., examine
        root directory, list files in `app/models`, read `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`,
        search for `User.find`).\n5.  **Select Optimal Tool:** Choose the *single
        tool* that directly achieves your planned next step. Prioritize `take_notes`
        if step 3 identified key info to save *before* exploring further.\n6.  **Formulate
        Action:** Construct the arguments for the chosen tool precisely.\n\n=== TOOL
        USAGE GUIDELINES ===\n*   `shell_command`: Your primary exploration tool.
        Use specific commands:\n    *   `ls -l \u003cdirectory\u003e`: To list contents
        of a directory. Start broad (e.g., `ls -l .`) then explore subdirectories.\n    *   `cat
        \u003cfile_path\u003e`: To read the contents of a *specific* file identified
        via `ls` or other tools.\n    *   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`:
        For simple searches within a known file.\n    *   **AVOID**: Generic commands
        like just `explore`. Be specific.\n*   `examine_directory`: Use when you need
        a *summary* of *all* files in a directory, processed by `code2prompt`. Useful
        for getting an overview of a complex area like `app/services` *before* diving
        into individual files with `cat`. More costly than `ls`.\n*   `search_code_base`:
        Use *only* when you need to find specific code snippets, function calls, or
        keywords *across the entire codebase* (uses `rg`). Less useful for general
        structure exploration than `ls` or `examine_directory`.\n*   `explain_code`:
        Use *sparingly* only for short, specific code snippets already retrieved via
        `cat` or `search_code_base` that you cannot understand from context.\n*   `take_notes`:
        **CRITICAL**. Use frequently to record **significant findings** directly contributing
        to the answer:\n    *   Purpose of a directory or important file.\n    *   Key
        logic or data flow identified.\n    *   Relationships between different code
        parts.\n    *   Direct evidence answering the USER QUESTION.\n    *   Obstacles
        or errors encountered during exploration.\n    *   **Do NOT** use for trivial
        actions like \"Executed ls command\". Notes form the basis of the final answer.\n*   `analyze_code_question`:
        Usually only needed once at the start if the initial question is unclear (rarely
        needed in the loop).\n*   `finish`: Use **ONLY** when you are confident that
        the CURRENT NOTES contain enough information gathered through exploration
        to comprehensively answer the original USER QUESTION. Do not finish prematurely.\n\n===
        RESPONSE FORMATTING ===\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object adhering to
        the schema below.\nDO NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown
        formatting (like ```json ... ```) outside of the JSON object itself.\nYour
        entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\n--- SCHEMA START ---\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"action\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the tool to use or ''finish''.\",\"enum\":[\"analyze_code_question\",\"shell_command\",\"search_code_base\",\"examine_directory\",\"search_for_examples\",\"explain_code\",\"take_notes\",\"compile_findings\",\"finish\"]},\"arguments\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"description\":\"A
        hash of arguments for the chosen tool (string keys and values). Empty if action
        is ''finish''. Arguments should be passed as keyword arguments.\",\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"action\",\"arguments\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n---
        SCHEMA END ---\n"}],"temperature":0.3}'
